“When people speak ol the Church‚” says Wyclil, “they mean
thereby prelates and priests, endowed monks, canons and begging
iriars (‘prelatis and prestis, monitis and chanouns and freris’), and all
who wear the tonsure (⁴alle rnen that han crownes’)‚ however disrepu·
table and contrary to the word ol God their life may be. On the
other hand, they say that people in the world are not men nithe
holy Church, though they live ever so faithfully according to God's
law, and die in perfect love ol their neighbour. But notwithstanding
this, all those who will one day be blessed in heaven are members ol
holy Church, and no one besides.”¹

ln other passages also he argues in a similar manner against the
belief that by the Church is to be understood only the visible
Catholic Church, i. e. in its character oi an organised community,
under priestly government: and the notion that the Church and the
clerical body are identical‚ so that all members ol the latter would
belong to the Church, whereas the laity would be excluded from it²

This false conception-so Wyclil declares-is to be met with
even amongst men holding high ecclesiastical ollices‚⁸ and yet it is 2..
evident, that many ol the enors into which Christians have fallen,
are a result of this εοιιςορῐίοιι.ι He maintains it to be especially
needlul at this time to prepare the way for a juster view ol the
Churcht⁵ and that the Bishops ought to rejoice that this should
be done, because the responsibility ol instructing the people iu the
true belief concerning the Church, and of repelling all attacks made ⁸
upon the Church by heretics lies heaviest upon them.⁸

one another. The first defines and elucidatas Wyclil's conception ol
the Church, and the relation to the Church ol the clerical order and
