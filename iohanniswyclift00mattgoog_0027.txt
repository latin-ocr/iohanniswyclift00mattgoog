used to entertnin the auditory of his sermons.¹ The enthusiastic
admiration of lhcolaus Faulfiscb for Wyclif appears in his having
brought to Pragne not only a certificate (stated to have been forged
by Faulhsch himself) giving the attestation of the University of Oxford
to Wyclifs orthodoxy-but also apiece of Wyclif's gravestone, which
was venerated by the Bohemian Wycliffites as a precious relic.²

lt is very curious, that llus, when questioned nt the Council, could
not remember who the compnnion of Faulfisch had been. On being
asked who had brought this “forged” document to Prague, he answered,
“Nicolaus Faulfisch, with another, whose name l do not hnow”. And ·
yet George of Knyehnicz was studying at Prague, and toolt academical
degrees there, at the time that Hus was Rector of the University.⁸

The three tracts contained in Cod. A. were not originally bound
together into one volume. This may be seen, not so much from the
separate paging of each tract, as from the circumstance that they hare
not been bound in the same order in which they were written. The
first in date was the “De veritate sacrae scripturae”: then came the “De
dominio divino”‚ and lastIy “De ecclesia”: in the present volume how·
ever “De ecclesia” is placed in the middle. ’

lt is erident also that the three tracts were not bound together
before they reached bohemia, for a parchment document, relating to
the founding of a Church in the Morarian town of Meteritz,⁴ forms
