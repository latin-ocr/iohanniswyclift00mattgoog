whether he is a member of the Church at su¹ lf any Christian
could be head of the Church, at the same time with Christ, the Church
would be a monster, having two heads. Hence the Apostles with one
accord declarcd themselves to be only servants of this Head, and of
the Church: and never did any one of them presumo to assert that
he himself was the hendor the bridegroom of the Church.² No
Christian can determine the Pope to be the head, or even a member,
of the Church, either by clection or by any statute, for membership
depends upon the predestination and grace of eod)

lt is no article of the faith that one must obey the Pope in
order to be saved; for there were holy men ia days before the Papacy
was known. ln the days of the Apostles, and even at the present time,
there have been, and are, individuals and whole nations who never
heard of the existence of the Pope. Moreover there are periods during
which the papal chair is unoccupiod.

'l'he Pope is not the head of the universal, but only of the
particular (militant) Church, and this too only if he lives in accordance
with the commands of Christ⁴. ln that case we owe him obedience,
but so far only as he enlorces the commanda of Christ. Further
than this, nothing can tend to the spiritual good ol the Christian
but a sound raim·

Upon every command of the Pope, we must enquire whether that
which he orders is in harmony with the Bible; and this is one

. reason why every Christian ought to be acquainted with the Holy
Scripturea⁸

lt need not be objected, that in this case no Christian would

believe that his Priest‚ Vicat or Bishop was predestinata, aad therefore

¹ Nullus papa debet presumere se esse caput ecclesie . . . aaa sic assereret
quod sit predestinatus, eo qaod nonest de substancia fidei quod iste sit pre·
destinatus ²ldeo apostoli confessi sunt concorditer se esse servos istius
capitis; nunquam antem presumpsit aliquis apostolorum asserere se esse caput. 'Noa „
est ia potestate alicuius christiani, constitucione, eleccione vel acceptacioae statuere ι
quod dominus papa alt caput vel membrum ecclesie, namhoc consistit ln predesti-
nacione et gracia Dei nostri. ‘Dominus papa non est caput universalia sed
particularis ecclesie, dnm tamea perseveranter vixerit tamquam papa, si nonest
predestinatus, noa est capitaneus in ecclesia sancta Del. ⁵Omnibus suflicit ad
salutem tides formata qaod sit una universitas fidelium predestinatorum. ⁸ Et j
hec est racio quare oportet omnem catholicum cognoscere scripturam sacram.
