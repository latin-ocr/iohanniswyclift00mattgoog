ln what sense then are we to understand these privileges? «
(Cap. xi.) The King of England may bestow privileges for the advantage ⁴
of the Church, by virtue of his royal power. Therefore he alone has ’
the right to interpret them; and if the Bishop of Rome, or any of ι
his priests learned in the law, should be asked conceming the inter·

be better for the consecrated places themselves that they should not
possess privileges which burden them with worldly care. However, the ,
