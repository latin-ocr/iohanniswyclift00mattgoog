⁴5. The Edition. ’

Ol the three manuscripts in which Wyclil's book on the Church
has been preserved, A has lormed the basis ol the following text:
the Codex A being not only, comparatively speaking, correct, but one
which moreover was copied in England.

On account ol the great length ol the chapters, the copyist ol
dhas divided them into numerous paragraphs (A, B, C, D dec),
and even these paragraphs are again subdivided (a, b, c dc, r, a, 3 dte).
This arrangement has been retained in the present edition, partly ior

⁴ letters and ligures on the left hand margins is at first sight somewhat
conlusing .
