ι At the present date, at which only acomparatively small portion
ἶ oi Wyclii's works have appeared in print, it may still be doubtful to
” which oi them the palm belongs, both in respect of iorm and contents;
¹: but at least it may saiely be said, that his book on the Church must
³ be reclroncd amongst his ripest and rnost important utterances. For,
let us consider what a poweriul impression the work by lius
bearing the same title, produced upon his contemporaries; aworlr
which, as Pierre d’nitly said,¹ “by its immense abundance oi proois‚
‚ combats the authority and plenary power ol the Pope, no less than
,ἶ the Koran combats the Catholic faint. And yet this celebrated
ἴ book is only a meagre abridgment ol Wyclif‘s “De Ecclesia”. What «
’. ii the contemporaries oi llus, who as assembled at Constance
l represented the intellectual capacity of the Europe oi that day, had
ἐ known the original that be had drawn upon, instead ol the ieeble

imitation!
’i ln order rightly to understand the origin oi the treatise on the
ᾖ Church, we must go back to the years 1377 and 1378, during
⁴ which Wyclif found himself exposed to attaclr from the combined
i forces of the hierarchy, or, as many at that time said, ol the Church.

The hierarchy however is not the Church: and it ia the distinction
· between what the Church is in reality‚ and what the multitude under·

Ι stand by ἰῐ,π which Wyclii seta himself to expound in this work.
