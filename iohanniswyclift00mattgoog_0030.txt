Both the tracta in B are written by the same hand, ln clearly
defined, legible characters. Whether the copy was made in England
or Bohemia, must remain undecided Only thus much is certain: —

ι. That it is no more a copy of A, than A is of B.

2. That Α and Β proceed from one and the same source (X).-
Α directly, Β perhaps through an intermediate lint.

The first point is evident for the following reasons: -

ι. Wherever gaps occur in A, whether large or small, Β has the
complete text: therefore Β c'annot be derived from Α.

2, On the other hand, in certain cases where there are gaps in B, ·

A har the complete text.

That A and B had a common origin, the following consideratione
will shows -

ι. Certain words are indistinctly written, both in Α and in B,
and therefore presumably were so in their original.

2. Certain marginal notes, such as figures, letters and ⁴tables of ·

contents correspond in A and B, in an arrangement which is often ’

singular, and (in the case of the tables of contenta) in a wording ἱ1

frequently strange

The relation of the three Manuscripts to one another stands there·

A MS. containing a part only of the treatise “De Ecclesia”, .
Cod. C. ι. 23 of the Trinity College library, Dublin, does not belong
to this group of MSS. and calls for separate consideration.

This Codex contains only the 7⁸¹¹ chapter, registered by Shirley
