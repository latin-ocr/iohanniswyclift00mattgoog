ln the Imperial Library 01 Vienna there are two more Codices,
3930 and 4507, which 11010 been supposed 1000111010 the treatise “De
ecclesia”.¹ ssut as Shirley has already shown ², there has been a con·
1110100 11010 with Wyclil's “De fide catholica’'. ’1110 identity 01 1110
incipit makes it probable, 11101 this is the first book 01 ‘De Ecclesia
et Membris'‚ 0 work quite distinct 11010 111οι010010 book 01100 Summa
Theologiae”. 11 must however be remembered that, although the treatise
“De Fide Catholica” is a distinct work 01 Wyclil's, it does contain, 1110
very abridged lorm, much that, had been already given in 11)000010011.”

Α 10111101 explanation 01 the confusion between the two works ·

· is to be 1000010 the lact that, in the table 01 contents 01 the two

manuscripts 3930 and 4507, the treatise “De fide catholica” is cata·
logued under the title “De ecclesia''.

3. Date 01 composition

Shirley has rightly fixed the time 01 composition at 1378 01 1379.1
With regard to certain parts 01 the tract, 0 still closer limit may 00

set. Although the entire work owes its existence to Wyclif's contest .
with Gregory Xl - the “horrible fiend'',⁴ who never could have been -

head 01 1110 Church - 000 although some passages so breathe the
spirit 01 1001 conflict that it can hardly be imagined but that they
were penned during Gregory's life-time, — nevertheless by 101 1110
greater part 01 the tract was written 01101 1110 death 011001 Ροο1111,
which took place on the 071ΙΙ 01 March, 1378.ὅ 11 we bear in mind
