’4 ln spite ol. the care with which Nicolaus Faulfisch and bis com· ι

' correct text ol “De ecclesia” would have been very poor, bad 1 not
,ς lately been' so fortunate as‘ to lind a Codex¹ in which tlte treatise
l is in a lar better condition in these very passages. This manuscript,
1 which came into my hands almost by chance in the year 1883,
“’ is the Codex 11 D. ιι. 11 the Univetsity library ol Prague.
; l This Codex, to which we will teser as B, a large lolio volume .
l' 4’ᾗ (auxum) consiste 11114 paper leaves, ol which the last is leit
Ξ blank. lt contains first the tract “De ecclesia'’ (tot. 12-1302) and
,' Wyclil's “De olficio regis” (130¹-2tol’). There is besides in the
’ appendix aa extract lrom the treatise “De olficioregis” (tot. 1111- 21²⁸)
ζ and extracts ltom the first twelve chapters ol “De ecclesia” (fol.
ἐ 111·-1148). The external arrangement ol A is very much the 1111111 ·'
