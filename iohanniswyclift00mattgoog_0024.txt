have very little to do with what precedes or follows. The two next
. chapters, xvtt and xvttt, are chiefly devoted to tlte question of the anti·
quity of the Church. ln opposition to those who maintain that tlte
Church only arose after Christ's death, Wyclif shows (as he says himself)
by very exhaustive reasoning‚ that the Church existed long before

Christ’s incarnation. The relation of the reprobate to the Church, already ·

treated by Wyclil in the second and following chaptets, forms a main
’ part of chapter xrx. Wyclif gives special attention to the enquiry
whether a praescitus may hold a spiritual office (a question which

he answets in the negative); he then enquires by what marks the ⁴⁹

Ι praescitus priest may be known, and how the Christian should act
with regard to his spiritual functions. The laytnan need not be
disturbed, provided that he himself hold the true faith.¹ But if no
praescitus belongs to the fellowship of the Church, not having
indeed received a valid baptism-the question arises, What merit
will the praescitus gain for time and eternity, should he lead a right
life? ln this world he will obtain prosperity, and a mitigation of his
penalty itt the next.

Only he who holds the true view of the Church-Wyclif further
teaches-can rightly understand certain passages in the Soug of
Songs, in the book of Proverbs, and in the Apocalypse. The whole
ol the twentieth chapter is an exposition of Prov. xxxt. to-3t.
The exposition is on the model of St. Angustiae and is partly borrowed
from his commentary on the same passages (Opp. v. pars t., pag.
151-194). This chapter has also a parallel in one of Wyctits serruons,
and was perhaps composed earlier than tlte other portions ol this work.

Wyclif's doctrine, that if the cletgy should misuse their power, it
behoved the laity to deprive them of their temporalities, naturally
found vehement opponents amongst the defiat-ranke. Chapter xxt.

contains areply to one of these. 'l’be rest of the chapter, as also ·

chapter xx11,is chiefly occupied with a succession of subtle question·
ings concerning prayers for the dead, and the number and nature of

the Sacramenta, especially as to what is received in the ordination of ·
