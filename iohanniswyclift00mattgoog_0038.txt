xxx lNTRODUCTlON. ι

shall not be surprised to find that Simon ol 'lisanow was thoroughly
acquainted with that work.

Alter the condemnation ol Hus, Simon, at that nme Vicat ol
Tobitschau in Mortuis, became involved in a dispute with amonk

ol the Canthusian Convent oi St. iosaphat at Olmbtz‚ who impugned jc:
the orthodoxy oi his doctrine. From the documenta relating to this {²3

controversy, which have come down to us, we leam that Simon oi zi.
Tissnow had not only entirely adopted Wyclii's theory ol the Church, ι.
but had propagated it by public discoutses.¹ Simon’s opponent, Paul ,ἓ

oi Progne, endeavours in two treatises to confute this Wyclilfite ⁸:
doctrine. ln the second ol these it is clear, even lrom the opening
words “Utrum ecclesia sancta sit numerus predestinatorum‘', that Wyclil '3
is the object ol attack.² This treatise contains the following significant s]

passage on the relation ol the Hussites to wyclitz- “Si autem dicant 3·

quoda Deo venerint et ab apostolis atque evangelio ·- sed econtra: h
Non multum temporis est quod esse ceperunt, quoniam sicut patet a
iohanne Wycleff exordium acceperunt, qui hanoniam Hussitarum incepit. .“;

One oi Simon oi Tissnow’s disciplet was John Laurin, who in . '

the year ¹4¹7 defended publicly at Progne Wyclil's doctrine ol the
Church: in consequence oi which he two years later received a legal
summons from Paul ol Prague, to answer to the charge oi holding
heretical opinions. Λ regular lawsuit ensued between John Laurin,
who meanwhile had become Canon ol Olmtitz, and Paul ol Prague.
John Laurin was compelled greatly to modify his statements.

Many other ol the Hussites expressed themselves to the same ¹·

effect as John Laurin on the subject ol the Church, and quite in the

sense oi Wyclil's theory: hut it is not my intention here to examine ’
either their* declarations, or those ol an opposite character such as ·

were made by Andreas ol brod, Stephon ol helein, and others.

¹ 'insutus eontra llussitns presertim contra magistrum Simonem de Tyssnow‚ i

plebanum Towacroviensem autore magistro plebano de Dolan diocesis Olmucensis
oiim s theologie Prage doctoris”‚ so runs the title to this tract, which ia contained
in Cod. 303 oi the State Archires at bruun. ²This will also be seen from
tlte following passage in the first tracte “Sed quia secta limitatum, que dicit quod
oeelesia uncta catholica sit numerus omnium predestinatorum, peccat mortalissinse
oontm hune articulum fidei . . . igitur in tractatu presenti probabitur . . . quod talia
propositio sit salsa, heretica, impossibilis, caput et origo tocius heresis liussitarum . ..
